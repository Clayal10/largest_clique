INTRODUCTION
This is a project I completed in an artificial intelligence class at school. It attempts to solve the maximum clique problem. The program takes a graph in the form of a .csv file. The program is hard coded to accept a graph that is a size of 20x20. The output will create a file called "clique_solution.txt". The output will be an array of letters that coorespond to the graph row/column labels.
